What is your favorite / least favorite place for food on campus?
Favorite would have to be the exchange and least favorite is gallo de oro

What do you like / dislike about it?
At the exchange I like the people and the hot food, and at gallo I dislike the 
fact that it is pretty much just chipotle but worse and similarly priced
